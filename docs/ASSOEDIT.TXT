ASSOEDIT
Version 2.1.2
March 25, 2013

Release notes:

This is a bugfix release of Henk Kelder's (final) ASSOEDIT 2.1. See NOTES on ASSOEDIT, below,
for the specific changes in this version.

Andy Willis did the work, and I, Lewis Rosenthal, updated this readme and the package(s).


                   === DISCLAIMER ===

For all versions up through 2.1:

I allow you to use and distribute ASSOEDIT freely under the condition that I am in no way 
responsible for any damage or loss you may suffer. 

Henk Kelder, hkelder@inetgate.capgemini.nl

For 2.1.1 and above:

The same disclaimer applies, but if you run into trouble, instead of contacting Henk, 
see the section on support, below.


                   === NOTES on ASSOEDIT ===

Assoedit.exe allows you to inspect or modify associations set for file- and typefilters.
You can add new associations, remove old ones and change defaultsassociations. Also, you can 
add new filetypes.

Simply copy ASSOEDIT.EXE and ASSOEDIT.HLP to your harddisk. (If you do not already have 
WPTOOLS.DLL somewhere in LIBPATH, copy the enclosed one either somewhere accessible from 
LIBPATH or into the program directory. Optionally, copy ASSOEDIT.ICO into the same directory 
as ASSOEDIT.EXE.

If you do not start ASSOEDIT.EXE from the same directory where the .hlp file is located, make 
sure you have placed the .HLP file in a directory that is included in your HELP path in 
CONFIG.SYS (SET HELP=...).


This version of ASSOEDIT supports:

o  OS/2 2.0 GA 
o  OS/2 2.0 GA with service pack dated oktober 1992
o  OS/2 2.10
o  OS/2 2.11 (= 2.10 + SP)
o  OS/2 3.0 (WARP)
o  OS/2 Warp 4.x
o  eCS 1.x
o  eCS 2.x

Notes on version 1.1:

o   You've just got it.

Notes on version 1.2:

This version now also supports:

o   OS/2 2.1 BETA (march '93 - Kernel version 6.498)

o   OS/2 3.0 Warp

Notes on version 1.3:

o   You can now drag a SINGLE workplace shell program object into the listbox that shows 
    associated programs.

Notes on version 1.4:

o   Corrected an error where ASSOEDIT was unable to translate OBJECT handles back to file names. 
    This only occured when the workplace shell stored more than 64 Kb in its internal 
    handle-to-file tables.

Notes on version 1.5:

o   Corrected a problem that was caused by the correction in version 1.4.

Notes on version 1.6:

o   Now works with warp 4.0    

Notes on version 2.0:

o   Fixed a problem where ASSOEDIT didn't recoqnize certain file system objecthandles.
o   AssoEdit now also uses WPTOOLS.DLL.

Notes on version 2.1:

o   Just make sure ASSOEDIT works with WPTOOLS.DLL version 2.11.

                   === SUPPORT ===

Support for versions 2.1.1 and above is on an as-available basis. Your first contact is to
post a message on the eCS-Technical mailing list on Yahoo! Groups. If that fails, you may
contact me directly, and I'll do my best to respond in a timely manner with a substantive
answer:

                   === ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS ===

This release could not have been possible without the outstanding original work by Henk Kelder, 
and his generosity of providing the source code to Netlabs for safe keeping and easy access.

In addition, Andy Willis did the real work this time, and Steven Levine provided thoughts, 
opinions, and pointers during the discussion. :-)

Thanks also to Maurice Gu‚ron for reporting the "paths with dots" issue to me.
